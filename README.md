# Sky Shooter - Multiplayer - MLAPI (Unity)

# Purpose
This is incomplete, and I don't think I will be completeing it at all. As I used this to learn the basic MLAPI, the sample by unity (Boss Room) was too complicated for me to understand from. So I did my own example to learn it. 

# Concepts used

- Menu UI
- Loading Scene
- Scene Change
- Game Pausing 
- Dialog showing
- Prefabs Creation and Usage

    - Communcation between Server and Clients
    - Join Different Server
    - Host Server
    - Scene Switching
    - Position Sync
    - Objects Spawning and Despawn
    - Only Owner can move.
    - Same scenes are used for offline version as weell.
    - Generic Coding.
